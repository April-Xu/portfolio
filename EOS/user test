We conducted three user s of our final application. The main critiques are as follows:
Increase the amount of support and documentation from the application. Users didn’t know what they were supposed to be doing without extensive explanation and didn’t understand what the lights were supposed to be doing or how they related to friendship.
Users wanted to be able to directly track their progress with their friends in a meaningful and measurable way. A common denominator in people that we found that would want to use application, such as ours was that they wanted some way to measure their progress directly.

target user
People who yearn to get in touch with their old friends but unmotivated to do so. EOS is also designed for people who want to figure out their recent feelings related to the friend in a more unique, private and innovative way.

Our first idea was inspired by a diary. The virtual world is created by users taking pictures of their surroundings. Some elements can be identified in the picture and are manipulated by the user. The elements can also interact with the user once after being placed on the virtual planet.
Problems founded: this idea lacks user engagement and less motivate users to keep updating the planet.

The first wireframe is basically an archaic design and allows users to place customized elements onto the virtual planet. The core interaction is mainly a progression tracker where the progression can be tracked in visual forms like flower growing.

The landmasses imply the friends and the visual form of progression is hence the increase of landmass size. Two new features are added. One is a radial menu which allows the user to choose their feelings when adding on interactions with friends. The other one is a shake gesture to clear the fog covered on the landmass when some progression has taken place.
