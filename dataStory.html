        <h2>Project outline</h2><br><br>
        <p>This is a project about loneliness epidemic, a mental health issue that's
            been worse and worse after COVID19 quarantine.<br><br>
            The major elements of my story will be a hook, an introduction of current situation,
            an explanation about why loneliness is serious, a section of whose feeling of
            loneliness are mostly affected by COVID19 and how, a section of how to deal with it,
            and an appendix for acknowledging data sources.<br><br>
            I expect the readers to think about their current lives at first, be aware of the
            severeness of the situation, and be able to cope with similar situations after
            reading my story.<br><br>
            I plan to use Figma, Flourish, and Shorthand to design and develop my project. Figma
            will only be used for possible artifacts I might creat(e.g. some photo editing or
            some specific visualization) and Shorthand is used for the website. Flourish will
            be used for conventional or complicated data visualizations. I will use Figma to
            wireframe my ideas and redesign the projects based on future user research. I will
            conduct at least 3 user research, gather their feedback, and make revisions until
            it's polished and ready for presentation.

        <h2>Audience</h2><br><br>
        <p>My primary audience is pretty general. Anyone who has access to this website and is
            affected by the worldwide pandemic would be able to understand and potentially be
            interested in the content. If specifically, this story would target more on college
            students who are more concerned about this issue.I did several research to some
            representative audience and made revisions based on their opinions to make my project
            work for the general target audience.

        <h2>Work done so far</h2><br><br>
        <p>Design decisions:<br>
            1. I chose the color palatte of black and blue adapting to the topic of being alone
            under quarantine.<br>
            2. I tried to use the minimum amount of text to let my visualizations speak by
            themseleves.<br>
            3. I used infogram to visualize the health risk of being alone in order to make it
            intuitive and innovative.<br>
            4. I browsed through free stock images to find appropriate images that are consistent
            with the theme but at the same time not distractive.<br>
            5. I restructured and cleaned the data I found and created 2 simple visualizations in
            order to focus on the key information.<br><br>
            Things I've learnt:<br>
            1. User research is definitely helpful for finding out blindspots of projects even
            if there's only a small number of people tested.<br>
            2. Present in 60 seconds really enhanced my skill of synthesizing and extracting the
            core information of my presentation. It's been a very powerful practice that I can
            use in the future to reduce the unnecessary talkings.

        <p>Most of the data I have here are not raw data as in Excel other stypes of files so I
            will recreate the data based on them and used in my projects. I will also cite and
            mention the data source when it's used in my projects both at its presence and in the
            appendix. The data sources and the individual usages are:<br><br>

        <p>Based on the interviews, I got the following insights:<br>
        1. All of the participants are not so aware of the issue, which is representative for a
        general audience of this website who is experiencing quaratine but not an expert of
        relevant problems caused.<br>
        2. They all identified the key information in the website in the second question but they
        mentioned different things in question "what does this website tell you", which is
        surprising to me. I found it interesting that audience will tend to take what they don't
        know or what they find surprising as what they are told.<br>
        3. The visualizations overall is understandable but the details of the typography,
        labels, and the way the important information is highlighted should be revised because
        most of the audience found them confusing.<br>
        4. The intended audience is fairly clear to all audience.<br>
        5. The revisions participants want to make focus more on the later part of the story,
        which indicates more confusion about the data and call-to-action section.<br>
        6. Participants found out some ambiguity about the abstract concepts mentioned in the
        story, which can lead to confusions about the data. <br><br><br>
        Moving on, I would do these revisions to my website:<br>
        1. Refine the labels and typography of most visualizations to make the information
        clearer and more concrete.<br>
        2. Use Shorthand to make the whole website consistent in terms of style and design
        including color, layout, fonts, and typography.<br>
        3. Reconsider the raw data of "worsened relationship" and "impact of loneliness" and try
        out different types of visualizations.<br>
        4. Conduct more user research about iterated prototypes and redesign.<br><br><br>
            As final design iterations, I finally implemented the following changes to my data
            story:<br>
            1. Be consistent of overall design including colors, typography, and hierarchy,to create
            an engaging reading experience.<br>
            2. Restructure the data I have and only keep those valuable for my storytelling.
            Recreate the visualizations in Flourish to make it consistent with the design and
            conver the information more intuitively.<br>
            3. Refine the wording so that it's less confusing and provide more detailed
            explanation of ambiguous concepts.<br>
            4. Use appropriate inetractions in Shorthand to create a immersive experience and
            created some artifacts needed.
